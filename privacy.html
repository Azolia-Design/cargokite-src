                                    MailChimp is a service with which, among other things, the dispatch of newsletters can be organized and analyzed. When you enter data for the purpose of subscription to the newsletter (e.g. e-mail address), it will be stored on the MailChimp servers in the USA. The data transfer to the USA is based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union.

                                    We use MailChimp to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an e-mail dispatched using MailChimp, a file contained in the e-mail will connect to the MailChimp servers in the USA. It can then be established whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked on. Furthermore, technical information is registered (e.g. time of e-mail check, IP address, browser type and operating system). This information cannot be put into connection with the respective newsletter recipient. It is used exclusively for statistical analyses of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses may be used to adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.

The legality of the data processing operations that have already been carried out remains unaffected by the revocation. The data stored with us for the purpose of subscription to the newsletter will be stored until you unsubscribe from the newsletter, and will be deleted from our and the MailChimp servers after the unsubscription from the newsletter.
